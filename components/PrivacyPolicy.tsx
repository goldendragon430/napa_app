              You have the following privacy rights under the CCPA: ● Request to
              Know: You have the right to request to know the following
              information about our practices over the past 12 months: (i) the
              categories of Personal Information we collected about you; (ii)
              the categories of sources from which we collected the Personal
              Information about you; (iii) the categories of third parties with
              which we share Personal Information, (iv) the categories of
              Personal Information we sold or disclosed about you and for each
              category, the categories of third parties to which we sold or
              disclosed that particular category of Personal Information; (v)
              our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your
              Personal Information; and (vi) the specific pieces of Personal
              Information we collected about you. You may exercise your right to
              request to know twice a year, free of charge. If we are unable to
              fulfill your request to know, we will let you know the reason why.
              Please note, in response to a request to know, we are prohibited
              from disclosing your Social Security number, driver’s license
              number or other government-issued identification number, financial
              account number, any health insurance or medical identification
              number, an account password, security questions or answers, and
              unique biometric data generated from measurements or technical
              analysis of human characteristics. ● Request to Delete:You have
              the right to request that we delete the Personal Information that
              we have collected from you. We may deny your request under certain
              circumstances, such as if we need to retain your Personal
              Information to comply with our legal obligations or if retaining
              the information is necessary to complete a transaction for which
              your Personal Information was collected. If we deny your request
              to delete, we will let you know the reason why. ● Right to
              Non-Discrimination: If you choose to exercise any of these rights,
              we will not discriminate against you in any way. If you exercise
              certain rights, understand that you may be unable to use or access
              certain features of our Websites. If you would like to make a
              Request to Know or Request to Delete or are an authorized agent of
              a California consumer who would like to make such a request,
              contact us at [privacy@napasociety.io]]. We will take steps to
              verify your identity before processing your request to know or
              request to delete. We will not fulfill your request unless you
              have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify
              that you are the individual about whom we collected Personal
              Information. If you have an account with us, we will use our
              existing account authentication practices to verify your identity.
              If you do not have an account with us, we will not require you to
              create an account with us but we may request additional
              information about you so that we can verify your identity. We will
              only use the Personal Information you provide to verify your
              identity and to process your request, unless you initially
              provided the information for another purpose. You may use an
              authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to
              delete. When we verify your agent’s request, we may verify both
              your and your agent’s identity and request a signed document from
              you that authorizes your agent to make the request on your behalf.
              To protect your Personal Information, we reserve the right to deny
              a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have
              been authorized by you to act on your behalf. You may also make a
              verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
              California residents may also request information from us once per
              calendar year about any Personal Information shared with third
              parties for the third party’s own direct marketing purposes,
              including the categories of information and the names and
              addresses of those businesses with which we have shared such
              information. To request this information, please contact us at
              [privacy@napasociety.io]. Your inquiry must specify “Shine the
              Light Request” in the subject line of the email or the first line
              of the letter, and include your name, street address, city, state
              and ZIP code.
